        <h4>Hello, World!</h4>

        <p><em>Statement to police by Pietro Antonio de Fosaccia, waiter,
        regarding the conduct of the artist Caravaggio, 26 April 1604:</em></p>

        <p>About 17 o'clock [lunchtime] the accused, together with two other
        people, was eating in the Moor's restaurant at La Maddalena, where I
        work as a waiter. I brought them eight cooked artichokes, four cooked in
        butter and four fried in oil. The accused   asked me which were cooked
        in butter and which fried in oil, and I told him to smell them, which
        would easily enable him to tell the difference.</p>

        <p>He got angry and without saying anything more, grabbed an earthenware
        dish and hit me on the cheek at the level of my moustache, injuring me
        slightly... and then he got up and grabbed his friend's sword which was
        lying on the table, intending   perhaps to strike me with it, but I got
        up and came here to the police station to make a formal complaint...</p>
